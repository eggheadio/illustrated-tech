When my fellow eggheader [John Lindquist]() asked if I could help create some illustrations for his upcoming presentation on [JavaScript Proxies](), I was frankly a bit afraid.

After five minutes of googling it was obvious even experienced JavaScript developers have a hard time wrapping their head around proxy objects.

Programming is already an exercise in abstract thinking. But to layer on it, Proxies belong to the world of _meta_ programming â€“ one level of abstraction up!
