When my fellow eggheader [John Lindquist]() asked if I could help create some illustrations for his upcoming presentation on [JavaScript Proxies](), I was frankly a bit afraid.

After five minutes of googling it became obvious even experienced JavaScript developers have a hard time wrapping their head around proxy objects.

Programming is already an exercise in abstract thinking.  
But to layer it on, proxies belong to the world of _meta_ programming â€“ one level of abstraction up!

Nevertheless, where there's widespread confusion, there's also opportunity.  Bringing visual explainations and metaphorical thinking into the equation would give us a whole new set of lenses to see with.

### Chalk and Talk

We kicked off the project with a draw-and-chat session.  
John patiently walked me through the basics of proxies, while I sketched possible ways to diagram the main concepts.

Most of what I'm doing in these notes is trying to establish spatial relationships that make sense.  
And asking trippy questions to get there:
* Is the proxy object sitting above, below, or next to to it's target object? 
* Is it bigger or smaller?
* Does it wrap around it like a blanket?  
* It is even a solid object? Or more like a liquid or gas?  

One on level these questions might seem absurd. They're not though.

We're trying to build an imaginary physical world that helps turn proxies - some obscure, invisible programming functionality - into a visible reality that you, I, or any non-technical "normal" person standing next to us on the tube could conceivably understand.

Which involves asking weird questions about the location, material, colour, size, and weight of code.
