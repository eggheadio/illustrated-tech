# Thinking in Scrollytelling

The internet is severely lacking guides on the craft of scrollytelling.

Right now, I do not know how to create a scrollytelling article.  
I think I have about 60% of the puzzle pieces in hand.  
But I've yet to snap them all together, and track down the missing parts.

This is the story of me trying to complete that puzzle.

Here's where I'm at.

1. Everything [The Pudding](#) and [The NYT Interative](#) make gives me very deep feels.
2. I've done test-runs with most of the framework options – [Scrollama](#), [Interaction Observer](#), [Waypoints](#), [Scrollmagic](#)
3. 

## A Shift of Mind

One the biggest hurdles I'm facing is how to plan out a scrollystory.

We're working across more dimensions than I'm used to:
* Visual Design
* Pacing & Time
* Javascript Interactions


### The Toolbox

* Sticky Elements – Continuous Presence over Time
* Evolving Sticky Elements – Continuous Presence + Evolution over Time
* Evolving Scrolling Elements - Movement + Evolution
* Hover Overs
* Triggers
* Opacity & Reveals
* Sidenotes & References

### Pacing & Timing

* The Primary Timeline - The pace of the scroll controlled by the user
* Secondary Timelines - Elements moving at a different pace to the primary timeline
* Independent Timelines – Elements not tied to the primary timeline at all (eg. self-contained animations)
