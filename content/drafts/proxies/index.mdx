We pass the proxy magician two things:
A target object - which is the thing they'll perform their magic trick on
A handler â€“ which is the instructions for which magic trick to perform

We of course have to write the handler instructions before we call the proxy to perform its magic.

Handlers are made up of a series of traps.
Each trap is a particular step in the magic trick.
We can have multiple traps in each handler.
There are thirteen total types of traps we can setup:

```
getPrototypeOf()
setPrototypeOf()
isExtensible()
preventExtensions()
getOwnPropertyDescriptor()
defineProperty()
has()
get()
set()
deleteProperty()
ownKeys()
apply()
construct()

```

But there are two main ones that the vast majority of proxies use:
Get and Set
These are the classics - like the card trick and the ball shuffle.

Every trap comes with an if/else conditional that decides if the magician should "trap" the object and do its magic.
