Since taking the course in September of 2019, I've been building and developing my second brain over the past seven months.

Much like any well-integrated tool, the mental distance between you and the system grows small.  
It's a lovely little closed feedback loop â€“ <Link to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics">a cybernetic system</Link>.  
At this point almost all of my daily workflow revolves around my second brain. Links, articles, books, papers, podcasts, and half-formed thoughts go in.  
These build into notes and develop over time â€“ they merge, meander, and mature into talks and blog posts and illustrations.  
It is hard to remember what my workflow looked like without it.

For tools I'm currently using <Link to="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</Link>, backed up by <Link to="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</Link> for some fancy automation elements.

These notes cover the last two sections of the course. Enjoy!
