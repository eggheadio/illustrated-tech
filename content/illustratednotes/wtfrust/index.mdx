So, what's this Rust thing and why is everyone enamoured?  
Let's explore...

![Rust is a programming language mainly used to build 'system software.' Which means any software that acts as a platform for other software to run on top of it. iOS, linux, and windows are all system software. Rust is also becoming popular for making web apps. We can compile rust files into web assembly, which lets us run them in the browser.](./WTFRust_2.png)

![The power of rust is that it balances speed and safety. Safety here means memory safety. Mishandling how we store data on physical microchips can lead to bugs and security flaws. High-level languages are abstract and safer. Low-level languages work directly with memory, making them dangerous but fast. Rust lives in the happy middle ground](./WTFRust_4.png)

This happy balance Rust manages to strike - between speed, control over some memory storage, and being developer-friendly to 

![The rust install package comes with 'rustc' - the compiler, 'cargo' - the package manager, and 'rustup' - the toolchain](./WTFRust_3.png)

![Rust is statically typed. This means the data type of every variable must be known at compile time. You can declare data types or let rust make an educated guess. Rust's compiler is strict. It won't let you mix data types.](./WTFRust_5.png)

![Rust is obsessed with ownership. Every value belongs to a variable. Values are like pet hamsters, they need an owner. If LeBron owns this hamster, then we assign LeBron to Shaq, ownership move to Shaq. LeBron no longer owns the hamster.](./WTFRust_6.png)
