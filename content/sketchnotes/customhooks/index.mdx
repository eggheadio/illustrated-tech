[Shareable Custom Hooks in React](http://bit.ly/2G6aZDo)

![Course illustration of a fishing hook with a react reel for Custom React Hooks](./shareable-custom-hooks-in-react.png)

![Here's the basics of hooks - hooks let you hold state and lifecycle events inside functional components instead of class components. Hooks follow two rules. First, only call hooks at the top of your function. Second, only use them inside React functions. Not plain JavaScript ones.](./customhooks-1.png)

![There are two main built-in hooks. First useState holds and updates your app's state](./customhooks-3.png)

![Second, useEffect handles "side effects," which are anything that causes changes outside of rendering your functional component to the DOM](./customhooks-4.png)

![This course shows how to create useful, shareable hooks you can publish on NPM. You use the basic hooks like useState, useEffect, and useContext as the basic ingredients to cook up your own custom logic. You could create hooks like useBattery, useGeolocation, or useToggle. Making your own hooks is easier than you think.](./customhooks-2.png)

![Install the CLI tool create-react-hook. This creates a github repo for you and generates a boilerplate with name, description, and licence files. We can test our hook with react-testing-library before we publish.](./customhooks-5.png)
