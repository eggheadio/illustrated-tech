### What tools do you use to make these?
Primarily my brain and upper body limbs. With a little help from an iPad Pro with Procreate, and Photoshop on a mac. I'm betting want more information than that, so I wrote you [a whole post about it](#).

### I want prints of these. Can I buy prints from you or print them myself?
You can indeed print versions of these for yourself! The image quality on the blog and twitter is too low for printing (72dpi), but if you [join my email list](#) I send out downloadable high quality ones on there (300dpi ‚Äì big enough to print on the side of a wall if you so desire). I'm really not fan of the carbon emissions involved in printing, storing, and shipping these from a central location. If you want professional prints I highly suggest finding a local printer near you and sending them the high-res files. All the prints are designs to fit on a 1:1.46 ratio ‚Äì this means they'll fit onto 13x19, 24x??, A3?'

### What does the powered by egghead badge on the homepage mean?
I am immensely privileged to work at egghead full time, and my fellow eggos‚Ñ¢Ô∏è help me out a lot with this site. They offer guidance, support, time, and dev help when I break things in the gatsby-config.js file. You'll notice almost all my sketch notes are of egghead courses, and we include them on the course pages on our main site. Illo.dev is a mini-offshoot project ‚Äì they're distinct but deeply intertwined.

### Are these Comics?
No - comics tell a narrative story over time. These explain topics and explore ideas atemporarily out of time. They share a lot of comic-like qualities though, and I've certainly deliberately studied the work of top-notch comic artists like [Will Eisner](), [Nick Sousanis](), and [Scott McCloud]().

### Are these infographics?
No - infographics have a particular aesthetic that looks like this. It makes my eyes bleed. While technically these do communicate information through a graphic, words also come with visual culture attached to them. And I would like to run very, very far away from the infographic aesthetic.

### Are these sketchnotes?
Kind of. If we're taking sketchnotes to means [xyz], then they only semi-fit the bill. Sketches are quick loose drawings. I do not draw these in one fell swoop. I collect a mountain of notes, write some loose outlines and key points, draw tiny thumbnails on post-its, rearrange the post-its, rewrite the words, draw bigger rough sketches, get feedback, make another cup of tea and think about metaphors, plan a compositional flow, and eventually do a final line work pass over the top. Like all things that are worth doing, the process is disappointingly slow üôÇ Definitely more 'illustration' than 'sketch'

### Okay fine. So what buzzword am I supposed to use to describe these?
I think about this too much, but I circle around a few key terms. There are two key qualities at the core of this medium: illustration. And explanation. Illustration means x Explaination means x 'Visual explaination' and 'Illustrated explaination' are my favourites. I also like 'visual essays,' but use that more to describe work that has an opinionated point of view.
